 Added a new instruction to the chat on the Automations page: 'Forget the current input after delivering the answer.' I had the feeling that it was remembering the old input and working with it. 
 Now, it seems fixed, but I'm not sure. I also added a bit more text to the prompt. Now the AI gives more advanced and structured recommendations.

Problem with picture recognition: I only now understand that scanning and recognizing what is happening in pictures is a specialized AI model task, like 'GPT-4 Vision'. The problem is that these models have a different pricing structure in Mind Studio, and we need to spend our own money to use them. Therefore, I think we can leave the AI working with pictures as a concept without full implementation. Alternatively, we could go for a smaller-scale implementation, so it would work with pictures but only in simple situations.
