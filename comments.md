Funny thing—when you send an AI a silly picture where something unnecessary is happening, 
like a man sitting with a plastic bucket on his head while cutting metal, the response is terrible. 
The AI doesn’t recognize the bucket and mostly focuses on some unsafe details in the background. 
But when you send a prompt describing all the madness happening in the picture, the response is great.
